This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques, specifically a Decision Tree Classifier, to predict stroke risks using health and demographic data. It includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, and SMOTE for imbalance), feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis with visualizations. The analysis highlights key risk factors like age, BMI, and glucose levels, providing insights into stroke prevention. Ideal for showcasing skills in **Data Science**, **Healthcare Analytics**, and **Machine Learning**.
